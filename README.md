# Portfolio II

For my final project in Portfolio II, I decided to make a Character Creator. In RPGs, characters have different classes that help determine the stats of each character (ex. A rogue character would have have speed and attack whereas a knight character would have high health and defense, etc.)

My program would allow the user to create a character and choose a class for that character-- then the program would generate stats based on the chosen class.

### Project Plans

- [ ] Create basic program using C# (min 3 character classes, min 6 stats)

- [ ] Re-create basic program using JavaScript
- [ ] Add static visual assets using HTML/CSS (CodePen)
- [ ] Expand the code (possibly add more complex stats, more classes). 
- [ ] Add the option to personalize the characters with additional visual assets.
- [ ] Add animations.
